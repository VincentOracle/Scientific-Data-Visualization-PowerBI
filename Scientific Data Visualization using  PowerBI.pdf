Task 1
Tutorial 1: Power Query(Data Transformation and Group By)
Group By feature allows us to aggregate the data based on specific criteria. We
will be performing Aggregation functions like sum, average, count, etc. using
group by which is like SQL. Step 1:- Load the 1
st Dataset Named Transactions.csv and click on Transform Data.

Step 2:- Once you click on Transform Data it takes you to the Power Query Editor where you can
make changes to the dataset. Now, Click on New Source Located at the Top and load the rest of the Datasets.

Step 3:- I Have loaded 3 Datasets or Tables in total where there is no common attributes except
the Date Column in the DailyDelhiClimateTest.csv

Step 4:- Now I want to get the columns min and max values. You can do that by using a query. Right click and click on New Query -> Blank Query.
I have renamed the Date to permitdate. You can also rename the attributes name just by
clicking on the attribute and renaming it with the other name.

Step 5:- You can observe a new Query1 added to the Queries tab where I have selected the
transactions table to perform modifications.

Step 6:- The “=transactions” display the Transactions table. You will be able to find the Applied
steps at the right side under Query settings where the steps performed in that table will be
displayed. You can click on the X mark on that step if you want to remove that step from the
changes made.

Step 7:- In add column, Click on Custom column to create a new column. But our main purpose
is to perform Group by. The cells will be inserted with a 1.

Step 8:- Right click on the attribute and click on group By.
Step 9:- Go the advanced options and type the same min and max dates as shown in the fig
below and select the attribute for which you want the group by function to be applied.

Step 10:- Now the min date and the max date are displayed. From 1/1/2013 and 8/15/2017. You
can even round the dates to the nearest day, month, and year. For ex:- 8/15/2017 can be
rounded until 8/31/2017. As my dates are already in order I don’t want to sort them again based on the years starting
from 2013 to 2017.

Step 11:- Change the query where the sales and onpromotion is greater than 1.
Question 1 Points
Follow the Tutorial 1 and complete the below
task for the given attributes. Rename the store_nbr to your desired name
to all the tables. Apply group by on any table and perform the
same steps mentioned in the tutorial for any
other table except train. Use the Query tab as Step 11 and just display
the ID’s below 700000. Explain any difficulties while performing
these operations in detail in about 100 – 200
words.
Visualization – 5 Marks (each)

Please answer the following question
A. Filter the Dates in Transaction in
descending order and explain how you did
that along with the screenshot. Explanation with screenshot – 10 Marks

Task 2
Tutorial 2: Creating Relationships
We will be creating relationship between the attributes and display the cardinality
of the selected attributes. Step 1:- Go to the model view and right click on any table -> Create Relationship. Create all the
possible and necessary relations which can be one to one, one to many, etc.…. Follow the below relationships and create relationships between the tables and attributes.
TABLEAU TUTORIAL

14
Step 2:- I am creating a connection between DailyDelhiClimateTest table and
transactions table.
TABLEAU TUTORIAL
WERE VINCENT
15
Step 3:- We are creating a relationship between train and transaction table. I have selected 1
attribute from each table to link the tables. The cardinality is automatically populated based on
the data and attributes selected.
TABLEAU TUTORIAL
WERE VINCENT
16
Step 4:- The created relationships can be viewed using the manage relationships where the
active relationships give us that a connection between a table is active. Only a single connection
between tables can be active. For ex:- you can’t create 2 active relationships between the tables train and transactions and
vice versa.

17
Step 5:- The model view of the tables can be viewed after the relationships between the tables
are established.
Question 2 Points
Follow the above tutorial and try to find all
the possible relationships for the tables. Find all the one to one and many to one
relationship among the attributes. Will cardinality of the relationship really
affect the relationship and the way the
attributes interact with the other?
Explanation with Screenshot – 10 Marks
Please answer the following Questions
A. What happens if you select cross filter
direction as single and filter based on the
attributes?
B. Can we use multiple relations in the table
and set them as active? Please explain your
opinion. (Screenshot Mandatory)

Task 3
Tutorial 3: Visualizing using different tables
Step 1:- Select the date from the holidays_events table and transactions from the transaction
table and click on the Area chart to visualize the sum of transactions with respect to years.

Question 3 Points
Follow the Tutorial 3 and complete the below
task for the given attributes. Select the attributes Transferred, Type and
Date from Holidays_events and transactions
from transactions table. Take another page and select date, sales, and
store_nbr from train and use a clustered
column chart and explain both the attributes
roles in the visualization and explain your
findings. Use at least 3 visualizations and provide a
detailed understanding. (Note:- Visualizations Mandatory)

Display the Visual Table for the above
attributes in separate pages. Answer the following questions
A. What is the Highest sales in 2016 and How
much compared to the 2

Tutorial 4: Creating an attribute to group the attributes
In this tutorial we will be creating a group for the selected attribute by using the
below query. So, use the default bin settings and complete the tutorial. Step 1:- Here we will be doing forecasting on various attributes. Click on Custom Column and give the below query to get the mean. If you want to insert the
attributes then just click on the attributes and click on insert to use them in the query.

Question 4 Points
Follow the above tutorial complete the
following tasks. Use transactions to use grouping to the
attribute instead of Sales. Select all the attributes in Transactions table
to visualize and remove quarters from the
date in the X axis. Note the changes and compare the above
attributes using a line graph and Explain your

Task 5
Tutorial 5: Forecasting
In this task we will forecast the data along with time i.e. year. You will need to use
the below query to create a new attribute and select that attribute to forecast the
sales. Step 1:- Using the New measure by naming it Forecast_MeanTemp and choosing the home
table as DailyDelhiClimateTest. Use the below Query and you can see that an attribute named by Forecast_MeanTemp will be
created under DailyDelhiClimateTest.

Step 2:- Select date, Forecast_Sales attributes and select the Line chart.
Question 5 Points
Follow the above Tutorial and complete the
below tasks. Use Transactions attribute and create a new
measure by taking the query as a reference
and build a query on your own to forecast the
transactions data along with the date. Any additional attributes along with the
above are encouraged. (2 visualizations Mandatory)
